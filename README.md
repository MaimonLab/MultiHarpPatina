# Multi-Harp-Patina

A thin wrapper around the `MultiHarp` control library
for `Rust`. Provides a `DebugMultiHarp150` struct to
emulate the behavior of a `MultiHarp` without actually
being connected to one.

TODO
-----

- Make the debug simulation
more complete than it currently is.

- Implement White Rabbit functionality

- Implement FPGA functionality

- Implement event filtering.


## Usage

use multi_harp_patina;
