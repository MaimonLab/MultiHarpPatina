# Benchmarking

The speed of this library is basically constrained by the
speed of the MHLib itself. But it would be good to know
what that speed is on your system! So this module
provides some code for evaluating that speed -- it's
up to the user to ensure the MultiHarp is receiving data
at an acceptable rate!
